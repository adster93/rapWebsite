# Team Feature Branching

* Working with everyone at your table:
	* Get a copy of this repo
	* Use the g15_warmup branch to coordinate
	* Make a new feature branch
	* Make a new HTML page in the `pages` folder in that branch
	* Make a valid `index.html` file
	* Add a link to it in the `index.html` file
	* Merge all of the feature-branches from your table into g15_warmup
	* Resolve any conflict
* Individually, pull request back to this repo with all of your teammates pages and links

Note that you will have to communicate a lot to do this well!
